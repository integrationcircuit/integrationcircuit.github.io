# Chatbot UI

This is forked from Chatbot UI, an open source chat UI for AI models.

## Running Locally
**Please make sure you update the node.js to the latest version.**

### 1. Clone Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shuminCA/chatbot-ui.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

### 3. Provide Pipeline Endpoint and Bearer Token

Create a .env.local file in the root of the repo with your pipeline endpoint and bearer token:

```javascript
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT=YOUR_ENDPOINT
NEXT_PUBLIC_BEARER_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN
```

### 4. Run App
There are two methods to run the application: using npm or Docker.

#### Using npm

To run the app with npm, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash

**1. Create a docker image**

Build a docker image by running the following command:

```bash
docker build .
```
**2. Run the Docker Image**

After you have successfully built the Docker image, you can run it using either its image ID or SHA256 digest.
```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 {imageId/sha256}
```

Now you can run the chatbot at localhost:3000.

### 5. Use It

You should be able to start chatting. For better experience, please go to "Settings" -> "Theme" and select "light mode".
